# Image Setup Instructions

## Adding Your Studio Image

To complete the landing page design, please add your studio image:

1. Save your studio image as `studio.jpg` 
2. Place it in the `/public` folder
3. The image should be high quality (1920x1080 or larger)
4. Recommended format: JPG or WebP

The image will appear on the right side of the hero section on desktop, and stacked on mobile.

### Alternative: Use the Provided Image

If you have the Nordic Pilates studio image from the design mockup:
- Copy it to `/Users/martin/repos/NordicPilates/public/studio.jpg`

The page is configured to use `/public/studio.jpg` automatically.

## Current Status

✅ Hero section with split-screen layout ready
✅ Image component configured with Next.js Image optimization
✅ Responsive design (stacks on mobile, side-by-side on desktop)
✅ Overlay logo on the studio image
⏳ Waiting for studio.jpg to be added to /public folder

Once the image is added, refresh the page to see the updated design.
